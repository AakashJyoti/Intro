# Data Structure

A ways of managing data and perform operations on it for efficient usage of memory.

## Data Structure :

1. Primitive = Integer, Float, Char, Pointer
2. Non-Primitive = Arrays, Lists, Files

- Linear Lists = Stacks, Queues
- Non-Linear Lists = Graph , Tree

## Operations :

- Traverse
- Insertion
- Deletion
- Searching
- Sorting
- Merging

### Map & Set

## Algorithm

step to complete a task is algorithm

## Time Complexity :

number of line to execute to compete given task

## Space Complexity :

amount of space required to complete given task
