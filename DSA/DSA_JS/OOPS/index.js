// - Encapsulation : (Reduce complexity + Increase reusability) = group related variables and functions that operate on them into objects.
// - Abstraction : (Reduce complexity + Isolate impact of changes) = hide properties and methods from outside to make object interface simple and reduce impact of change.
// - Inheritance : (Eliminate redundant code)
// - Polymorphism : (Refactor ugly switch/case statement) = many forms

// Function with less parameters easy to maintain
